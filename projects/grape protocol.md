GRAPE is a decentralized social networking protocol to create, reward, and secure any online community by harnessing the power of Solana. $GRAPE is a currency that powers the Greate Ape social eco system. $GRAPE is a utility token that can be used to access our suite of community building features. These features will also be offered to other communities in exchange for project tokens or for burning/spending $GRAPE.
