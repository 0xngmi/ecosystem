Soda is a lending protocol with on-chain credit rating system. Soda will not only provides easy-to-use lending service but also builds a credit system, Sol ID. Sol ID will analyse both users' (to C) and protocols'/institutions' (to B) on-chain behaviours, and issue a score according to their behaviours. With this credit system we can achieve on-chain delicacy management and have a new option for protocol-to-protocol/business cooperation.
