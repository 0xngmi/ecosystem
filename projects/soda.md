Soda is a lending protocol with on-chain credit rating system. Soda provides easy-to-use lending service and credit system, Sol ID. Sol ID analyzes both retail users and protocols'/institutions' on-chain behaviors, and issues a score according to their trading behaviors. With this credit system we can achieve on-chain management and have a new mechanism for protocol-to-protocol/business cooperation.
