COPE is a two-phased project: Phase 1 of COPE seeks to evaluate trader weaknesses retrospectively based on trader calls made about crypto markets and provide reporting on this for self analysis. Top Call Makers are evaluated based on their call accuracy which, along with other parameters, results in a COPE score. The top 100 Call Makers are ranked within a COPE index by their COPE score. Once a consistent list of the top 100 has been generated with the monthly 'reformation' kicking out, introducing new Top Call Makers into the index provides a framework for new investment strategies based on accurately measured trader calls, which leads to phase 2.
