Larix — the lending protocol on the Solana blockchain, adopted a dynamic interest rate model and created more capital-efficient risk management pools, as such a broad selection of collateral types can be fully utilized in a safe way. Furthermore, the rewarding system based on a delicately designed token economy enables continuous incentive allocation to boost real demands.
It will be the combination of upgraded “Compound” and “MakerDAO” in the ecosystem, which accepts a broad selection of collateral types. Conventional banking business originated from deposit and loan model to reward excessive capital with interest. Lending protocol serves as an essential cornerstone of any Defi ecosystem. Defi lending platforms provide loans to borrowers with no intermediaries, usually enabling participants from both sides to earn stablecoins or cryptocurrencies.
