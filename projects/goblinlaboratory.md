The Goblin Laboratory is a culmination of over a decade's worth of backbreaking illustration work. But it's also a whole lot more than just a pretty pictures; it's an ambitious new venture into the next frontier of art creation on the blockchain. We're building a scalable platform, the Laboratory, that will empower artists and collectors alike to continually access, create, and share their riveting works. Our Laboratory Roadmap shows that we're working on in the short term, the medium term, and if the technology Gods allow it, the very long term.
