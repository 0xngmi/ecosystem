Lido lets users stake their assets for daily staking rewards. Users can stake any amount of tokens with no minimum. When staking Lido, staked tokens are minted which are pegged 1:1 to your initial stake. Staked tokens can be used across the DeFi ecosystem to compound yield. Lido lets users use staked assets to gain yield on top of yield. Use tokens (which earn daily staking rewards) as collateral, for lending, yield farming, and more.
