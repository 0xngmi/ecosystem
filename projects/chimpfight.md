**What is Chimp Fight?**

Where to begin.. well.. as everyone expected, the humans fucked it up. Earth is gone.

Technically it's still here but no body wants it anymore. Not even the humans that survived the war. They've long since abandoned us leaving only their machines and radiation behind for us.

Our kind was left to die in the wasteland they created... or so they thought.

We thrived in this new world the humans left us and have rebuilt society in our image. Stonger than ever we pushed forward through every obstacle in our way creating culture, art and contact sports similar to the games humans played.

Chimp Fight pits the most vicious warriors, devious shaman and crafty engineers against each other to battle for honor, bragging rights, and most of all... the human treasures.

Chimp Fight is a generative NFT play to earn game built on the Solana blockchain. Players will be able to customize their chimp fighters art to reflect their strategies & style as well equip items, consume trait power-ups and challenge their peers to combat with outcomes recorded forever on the blockchain. Several stages of combat development are under way ranging from 2D text combat to full VR interactions.
