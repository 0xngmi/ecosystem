Hiro brings innovation to Solana in a way that holds true to blockchain ethos. It not only provides new projects in the Solana ecosystem equitable and open access to venture funding, but also to the stewardship of those funds. By creating a meritocratic network with an innovative consensus and incentive mechanism, Hiro points focus towards the future, ensuring the longevity of its portfolio projects.

Hiro utilizes Solana for its high transaction throughput, which improves functionality of the voting systems and promotes fair access based on merit rather than ability to cover fees.
